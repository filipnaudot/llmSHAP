### Data Cleaning

* **Original dataset:** [Disease Symptom Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset).
* **Detected duplicates:** 4,616
* **Removed duplicates:** 4,616
* **Filtered dataset:** kept only 2 samples per symptom count (4–10 symptoms)
* **Output file:** `reduced_symptom_dataset.csv`
* **Final dataset size:** 14

Duplicates were removed using exact row matching (`pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates()`), ensuring only one unique record per symptom combination and disease remains.
